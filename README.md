# tutorials

This repository includes some R tutorials. They are not structured for a lecture series. Rather, it includes the packages and codes I had to learn 'on the go' to conduct the analyses I needed to for my own research projects, at some point in time. Or maybe I was just having fun with R because it was the pandemic and I had nowhere else to be.

The tutorials are named and organized in folders based on categories (such as tweet collection, or finding geolocations...), and likely to include .html files randered from R markdown files. 

For a human-friendly view of the html files with codes and instructions, pleae use this webpage: https://htmlpreview.github.io/
